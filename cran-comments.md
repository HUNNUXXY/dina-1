## Feedback

The previously submitted version of this package had a CRAN maintainer request
two requests. The first request dealt with the removal of latex style quotations
around the ``And'' in place of "And". Please note, the capitalization of the
"And" is important in the DINA model acronym and was left in place for this
reason. The second request was to remove a space between `doi:` and the identifier.
This was also taken care of.
